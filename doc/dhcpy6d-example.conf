# dhcpy6d example configuration
#
# The first section [dhcpy6d] contains general options.
# All sections whose name starts with "address_" are address definitions.
# These are used in the sections named something like "class_". These 
# contain definitions for classes of clients. The membership of clients
# of a class is defined in the client configuration from client config file
# or config database.
# Addresses contain various properties best seen on examples down below.
# Classes contain extra properties like nameservers for clients and
# filters.
# There is one predefined class: "default". If not set in an [class_default]
# section all clients which have no configuration or match no filter are
# automatically of this class. If [class_default] is not set the address
# "default" is used which also can be defined in an [address_defaut] section.

# DEFINITION OF AVAILABLE ADDRESSES

# Addresses are defined by patterns of static and variable parts.
#
# There are different categories: "random", "range", "id", "mac":
#
# $random64$  - calculate random 64 bit interface identifier address part
#               maybe future a version will allow shorter random
# $range$     - use range addresses - only in the last octet of address
# $id$        - if configuration of clients contain some kind of ID 
#             it can be used for one octet
# $mac$       - puts MAC address into 3 octets - works only on local subnet
#
# Categories and variables used in pattern must match!
# The two options every address definition must have are category and pattern.


# 1. Example: definition of a normal locally and globally connected valid client

# a globally unique address
[address_global] 
# Prefix length can be up to 64.
prefix_length = 64
# For privacy a global address might better be randomly created.
category = random
# This pattern results in an address like this: 2001:0db8:0000:0000:d3f6:834a:03d5:139c.
pattern = 2001:db8::$random64$
# IA type is mostly non-temporary as default so it is not necessary to declare here.
ia_type = na
# Lifetimes can be set in seconds for every defined address.
preferred_lifetime = 32400
valid_lifetime = 43200

# a unique local address
[address_local_valid]
# Prefix length can be up to 64.
prefix_length = 64
# For easier internal management put MAC address into address.
category = mac
# Given MAC 01:02:03:04:05:06 this pattern results in an address like this: fd01:db8:0000:0000:babe:0102:0304:0506.
pattern = fd01:db8::babe:$mac$
# Update these addresses in Bind DNS - defaults to "no"
dns_update = yes
# Zone to update.
dns_zone = example.com
# Reverse zone to update
dns_rev_zone = 1.0.d.f.ip6.arpa

# Define a class for normal valid clients.

# Different addresses should be separated by spaces.
# Note that "address_" from address definition section is omitted here!

pattern = fd01:db8:bad::$range$
# Lifetimes of address are shorter for faster reaction to status changes.

# 3. Example: definition of filtered clients

# Prefix length can be up to 64.
prefix_length = 64
# Filtered clients will get addresses of a range.
category = range
# Definition of range.
range = 1000-2000

pattern = fd01:db8::babe:0:0:$range$

[class_filtered_clients]

# filter_hostname
# filter_mac

# get an address of range fd01:db8::beef:0:0:1000 to fd01:db8::beef:0:0:2000

# 4. Example: default addresses for all unknown clients

# extra nameservers a class_default has to be set.

# Prefix length can be up to 64.
