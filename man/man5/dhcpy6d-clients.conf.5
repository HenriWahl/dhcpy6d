.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
This file contains all client configuration data if these options are set in
\fBdhcpy6d.conf\fP:
.sp
\fBstore_config = file\fP
.sp
and
.sp
\fBstore_file_config = /path/to/dhcpy6d\-clients.conf\fP
.sp
An alternative method to store client configuration is using database storage with SQLite or MySQLor PostgreSQL databases.
Further details are available at \fI\%https://dhcpy6d.ifw\-dresden.de/documentation/config\fP\&.
.sp
This file follows RFC 822 style parsed by Python ConfigParser module.
.sp
Some options allow multiple values. These have to be separated by spaces.
.SH CLIENT SECTIONS
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fB[host_name]\fP
Every client is configured in one section. It might have multiple attributes which are necessary depending on the configured \fBidentification\fP and general address settings from \fIdhcpy6d.conf\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.SH CLIENT ATTRIBUTES
.sp
Every client section contains several attributes. \fBhostname\fP and \fBclass\fP are mandatory. A third one should match at least one of the \fBidentification\fP attributes configured in \fIdhcpy6d.conf\fP\&.
.sp
Both of the following 2 attributes are necessary \- the \fBclass\fP and at least one of the others.
.SS Mandatory client attribute  \(aqclass\(aq
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBclass = <class>\fP
Every client needs a class. If a client is identified, it depends from its class, which addresses it will get.
This relation is configured in \fIdhcpy6d.conf\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.SS Semi\-mandatory client attributes
.sp
Depending on \fBidentification\fP in \fIdhcpy6d.conf\fP clients need to have the corresponding attributes. At least one of them is needed.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBmac = <mac\-address>\fP
The MAC address of the Link Local Address of the client DHCPv6 request, formatted like the most usual 01:02:03:04:05:06.
.TP
.B \fBduid = <duid>\fP
The DUID of the client which comes with the DHCPv6 request message. No hex and \e needed, just like  for example 000100011234567890abcdef1234 .
.TP
.B \fBhostname = <hostname>\fP
The client non\-FQDN hostname. It will be used for dynamic DNS updates.
.UNINDENT
.SS Extra attributes
.sp
These attributes do not serve for identification of a client but for appropriate address generation.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBid = <id>\fP \fBid\fP
has to be a hex number in the range 0\-FFFF. The client ID from this directive will be inserted in the \fIaddress pattern\fP of category \fBid\fP instead of the \fB$id$\fP placeholder.
.TP
.B \fBaddress = <address> [<address> ...]\fP
Addresses configured here will be sent to a client in addition to the ones it gets due to its class. Might be useful for some extra static address definitions.

.SH EXAMPLES
.sp
The next lines contain some example client definitions:
.nf
[client1]
hostname = client1
mac = 01:01:01:01:01:01
class = valid_client
.fi
.sp
.nf
[client2]
hostname = client2
mac = 02:02:02:02:02:02
class = invalid_client
.fi
.sp
.nf
[client3]
hostname = client3
duid = 000100011234567890abcdef1234
class = valid_client
address = 2001:cb8::babe:1
.fi
.sp
.nf
[client4]
hostname = client4
mac = 04:04:04:04:04:04
id = 1234
class = valid_client
