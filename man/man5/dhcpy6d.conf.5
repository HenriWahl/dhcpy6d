.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
This file contains the general settings for DHCPv6 server daemon dhcpy6d.
It follows RFC 822 style parsed by Python ConfigParser module.
It contains several sections which will be discussed in detail here.
.sp
An online documentation is also available at \fI\%https://dhcpy6d.ifw\-dresden.de/documentation/config\fP\&.
.sp
Boolean settings can be set with \fI1|0\fP, \fIon|off\fP or \fIyes|no\fP values.
.sp
Some options allow multiple values. These have to be separated by spaces.
.sp
There are 5 types of sections:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fB[dhcpy6d]\fP
This section contains general options like interfaces, storage and logging. Only one [dhcpy6d] section is allowed.
.TP
.B \fB[address_<address_name>]\fP
There can be various \fI[address_<address_name>]\fP sections. In several address sections several address ranges and types can be defined.
Addresses are organized in classes. For details read further down.
.TP
.B \fB[prefix_<prefix_name>]\fP
There can be various \fI[prefix_<prefix_name>]\fP sections. In several prefix sections several prefix ranges and types can be defined.
Prefixes are organized in classes. For details read further down.
.TP
.B \fB[class_<class_name>]\fP
Class definitions allow to apply different addresses, time limits et al. to different types of clients.
.TP
.B \fB[bootfile_<bootfile_name>]\fP
There can be various \fI[bootfile_<bootfile_name>]\fP sections. In serveral bootfile sections several tftp bootfile urls with restrictions
to CPU architecture and user class supplied by the PXE client can be defined.
.UNINDENT
.SH GENERAL CONFIGURATION IN SECTION [DHCPY6D]
.sp
This section contains important general options. Values are sometimes examples and not meant to be used in production
environments.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBreally_do_it = yes|no\fP
Let dhcpy6d \fBreally do it\fP and respond to client requests \- disabling might be of use for debugging and testing.
\fIDefault: no\fP
.TP
.B \fBinterface = <interface> [<interface> ...]\fP
The interfaces the server listens on is defined with keyword interface. Multiple interfaces have to be separated by spaces.
.TP
.B \fBmcast = <multicast\-address>\fP
The multicast address to listen at is ff02::1:2. Due to the facts that dhcpy6d at the moment works in local network segments only and to the restriction of MAC addresses only being usable there it will always have this value.
.TP
.B \fBport = <port>\fP
Exactly the same applies to the port dhcpy6d listens on. Default is 547. Probably senseless to change it but who knows.
.TP
.B \fBserverduid = <longlongserverduid>\fP
The server DUID should be configured with serverduid. If there is none dhcpy6d creates a new one at every startup.  Windows clients might run a little bit wild when server DUID changed. You are free to compose your own as long as it follows RFC 3315.
Please note that it has to be in hexadecimal format \- no octals, no "\-", just like in the example below.
The example here is a DUID\-LLT (Link\-layer Address Plus Time) even if it should be a DUID\-TLL as timestamp comes first.
It is composed of \fIDUID\-type(LLT=1)\fP + \fIHardware\-type(Ethernet=1)\fP + \fIUnixtime\-in\-hexadecimal\fP + \fIMAC\-address\fP what makes a \fI0001\fP + \fI0001\fP + \fI11fb5dc9\fP + \fI01023472a6c5\fP = \fB0001000111fb5dc901023472a6c5\fP\&.

\fIDefault: root\fP
.TP
.B \fBgroup = <group>\fP
For security reasons dhcpy6d can and should be run as non\-root group.
\fIDefault: root\fP
.TP
.B \fBnameserver = <nameserver\-address> [<nameserver\-address> ...]\fP

The domain to be used with FQDN hostnames for option 39.
.TP
.B \fBdomain_search_list = <domain\-name> [<domain\-name> ...]\fP

\fIDefault: no\fP
.TP
.B \fBlog_syslog_destination = syslogserver\fP
An UDP syslog server may be used if \fBlog_syslog_destination\fP points to it. Optionally a port other than default 514 can be set when adding ":<port>" to the destination.
.TP
.B \fBlog_syslog_facility = <log\-facility>\fP
The default syslog facility is \fIdaemon\fP but can be changed here.
\fIDefault: daemon\fP
.TP
.B \fBlog_mac_llip = yes|no\fP

\fIDefault: no\fP
.TP
.B \fBstore_config = file|sqlite|mysql|postgresql|none\fP
Configuration of clients can be stored in a file or in a database. Databases MySQL, PostgreSQL and SQLite are supported at the moment, thus possible values are \fIfile\fP, \fImysql\fP, \fIpostgresql\fP  or \fIsqlite\fP\&.

.TP
.B \fBcache_mac_llip = yes|no\fP
Cache discovered MAC/LLIP pairs in database. If enabled reduces response time and opens dhcpy6d to \fIpossible\fP MAC/LLIP poisoning. If disabled might increase system load.
\fIDefault: no\fP
.TP
.B \fBidentification = <mac> <duid> <hostname>\fP
Clients can be set to be identified by several attributes \- MAC address, DUID or hostname. At least one of mac, duid or hostname is necessary. Hostname is the one sent in client request with DHCPv6 option 39. Identification is used to get the correct settings for the client from config file or database.
Same MAC and different DUIDs might be interesting for clients with multiple OS.
\fIDefault: mac\fP
.TP
.B \fBidentification_mode = match_all|match_some\fP
If more than one identification attribute has been set, the identification mode can be one of \fImatch_all\fP or \fImatch_some\fP\&. The first means that all attributes have to match to identify a client and the latter is more tolerant.
\fIDefault: match_all\fP
.TP

.SH ADDRESS DEFINITIONS IN MULTIPLE [ADDRESS_<ADDRESS_NAME>] SECTIONS
.sp
The \fI<address_name>\fP part of an \fB[address_<address_name>]\fP section is an arbitrarily chosen identifier like \fIclients_global\fP or \fIinvalid_clients_local\fP\&.
There can be many address definitions which will be used by classes. Every address definition may include several properties:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBcategory = mac|id|range|random|dns\fP
Categories play an important role when defining patterns for addresses. An address belongs to a certain category:
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B \fBmac\fP
Uses MAC address from client request as part of address
.TP
.B \fBeui64\fP
Also uses MAC address from client as part of address, but converts it to a 64\-bit extended unique identifier (EUI\-64)
.TP
.B \fBid\fP
Uses ID given to client in configuration file or database as one octet of address, should be in range 0\-ffff
.TP
.B \fBrange\fP
Generate addresses of given range like 0\-ffff
.TP
.B \fBrandom\fP
Randomly created 64 bit values used as host part in address
.TP
.B \fBfixed\fP
Use addresses from client configuration only.
.TP
.B \fBdns\fP

.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBpattern= $prefix$::$mac$|$eui64$|$id$|$range$|$random$\fP
Patterns allow to design the addresses according to their category. See examples section below to make it more clear.
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B \fB$mac$\fP
The MAC address from the DHCPv6 request\(aqs Link Local Address found in the neighbor cache will be inserted instead of the placeholder. It will be stretched over 3 thus octets like 00:11:22:33:44:55 become 0011:2233:4455.
.TP
.B \fB$eui64$\fP
The MAC address converted to a modified 64\-bit extended unique identifier (EUI\-64) from the DHCPv6 request\(aqs Link Local Address found in the neighbor cache will be inserted instead of the placeholder. It will be converted according to RFC 4291 like 52:54:00:e5:b4:64 become 5054:ff:fee5:b464
.TP
.B \fB$id$\fP
If clients get an ID in client configuration file or in client configuration database this ID will fill one octet. Thus the ID has to be in the range of 0000\-ffff.
.TP
.B \fB$range$\fP
If address is of category range the range defined with extra keyword \fIrange\fP will be used here in place of one octet.This is why the range can span from 0000\-ffff. Clients will get an address out of the given range.
.TP
.B \fB$random64$\fP
A 64 bit random address will be generated in place of this variable. Clients get a random address just like they would if privacy extensions were used. The random part will span over 4 octets.
.TP
.B \fB$prefix\fP
This placeholder can be used instead of a literal prefix and uses the prefix given at calling dhcpy6d via the \fI\-\-prefix\fP argument like \fI$prefix$::$id$\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.TP
.B \fBia_type = na|ta\fP
IA (Identity Association) types can be one of non\-temporary address \fIna\fP or temporary address \fIta\fP\&. Default and probably most used is \fIna\fP\&.
\fIDefault: na\fP
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBpreferred_lifetime = <seconds>\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBvalid_lifetime = <seconds>\fP
As default preferred and valid lifetime are set in general settings, but it is configurable individually for every address setting.
.TP
.B \fBdns_update = yes|no\fP
\fIDefault: no\fP
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBdns_zone = <dnszone>\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBdns_rev_zone = <reverse_dnszone>\fP
If these addresses should be synchronized with Bind DNS, these three settings have to be set accordingly. The nameserver for updates is set in general settings.
.UNINDENT
.SS Default Address
.sp
The address scheme used for the default class \fIclass_default\fP is by default named \fIaddress_default\fP\&.
It should be enough if \fIaddress_default\fP is defined, only if unknown clients should get extra nameservers etc. a \fIclass_default\fP has to be set.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fB[address_default]\fP
Address scheme used as default for clients which do not match any other class than \fIclass_default\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.SH PREFIX DEFINITIONS IN MULTIPLE [PREFIX_<PREFIX_NAME>] SECTIONS
.sp
The \fI<prefix_name>\fP part of an \fB[prefix_<prefix_name>]\fP section is an arbitrarily chosen identifier like \fIcustomers\fP\&.
A prefix definition may contain several properties:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBcategory = range\fP
Like addresses prefix have a category. Right now only \fIrange\fP seems to make sense, similar to ranges in addresses being like 0\-ffff.
.TP
.B \fBrange = <from>\-<to>\fP
Sets range for prefix of category \fIrange\fP\&.
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B \fBfrom\fP
Starting hex number of range, minimum is 0
.TP
.B \fBto\fP
Maximum hex limit of range, highest is ffff.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBpattern = 2001:db8:$range$::\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBpattern= $prefix$:$range$::\fP
Patterns allow to design the addresses according to their category. See examples section below to make it more clear.
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B \fB$range$\fP
If address is of category range the range defined with extra keyword \fIrange\fP will be used here in place of one octet.
This is why the range can span from 0000\-ffff. Clients will get an address out of the given range.
.UNINDENT
.TP
.B \fBlength = <prefix_length>\fP
Length of prefix given out to clients.
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBpreferred_lifetime = <seconds>\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBvalid_lifetime = <seconds>\fP
As default preferred and valid lifetime are set in general settings, but it is configurable individually for every prefixk setting.
.TP
.B \fBroute_link_lokal = yes|no\fP
As default Link Local Address of requesting client is not used as router address for external call.
Instead the client should be able to retrieve exactly 1 address from server to be used as router for the delegated prefix.
Alternatively the client Link Local Address might be used by enabling this option.
\fIDefault: no\fP
.UNINDENT
.SH CLASS DEFINITIONS IN MULTIPLE [CLASS_<CLASS_NAME>] SECTIONS
.sp
The \fI<class_name>\fP part of an \fB[class_<class_name>]\fP section is an arbitrarily chosen identifier like \fIclients\fP or \fIinvalid_clients\fP\&.
Clients can be grouped in classes. Different classes can have different properties, different address sets and different numbers of addresses. Classes also might have different name servers, time intervals, filters and interfaces.
.sp
A client gets the addresses, nameserver and T1/T2 values of the class which it is configured for in client configuration database or file.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBaddresses = <address_name> [<address_name> ...]\fP
A class can contain as many addresses as needed. Their names have to be separated by spaces. \fIName\fP means the \fIname\fP\-part of an address section like \fI[address_name]\fP\&.
If a class does not contain any addresses clients won\(aqt get any address except they have one fixed defined in client configuration file or database.
.TP
.B \fBprefixes = <prefix_name> [<address_name> ...]\fP
A class can contain prefixes \- even most probably only one prefix will be usefull. \fIName\fP means the \fIname\fP\-part of a prefiy section.
.TP
.B \fBanswer = normal|noaddress|none\fP
Normally a client will get an answer, but if for whatever reason is a need to give it an \fINoAddrAvail\fP message back or completely ignore the client it can be set here.
\fIDefault: normal\fP
.TP
.B \fBnameserver = <nameserver\-address> [<nameserver\-address> ...]\fP
Each class can have its own nameservers. If this option is used it replaces the nameservers from general settings.
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBt1 = <seconds>\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBt2 = <seconds>\fP
Each class can have its own \fBt1\fP and \fBt2\fP values. The ones from general settings will be overridden. Might be of use for some invalid\-but\-about\-to\-become\-valid\-somehow\-soon class.
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBfilter_hostname = <regular_expression>\fP
.sp
\fBfilter_mac = <regular_expression>\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBfilter_duid = <regular_expression>\fP
Filters allow to apply a class to a client not by configuration but by a matching regular expression filter. Most useful might be the filtering by hostname, but maybe there is some use for DUID and MAC address based filtering too.
The regular expressions are meant to by Python Regular Expressions. See \fI\%https://docs.python.org/2/howto/regex.html\fP and examples section below for details.
.TP
.B \fBinterface = <interface> [<interface> ...]\fP
It is possible to let a class only apply on specific interfaces. These have to be separated by spaces.
.TP
.B \fBadvertise = addresses|prefixes\fP
A class per default allows to advertise addresses as well as prefixes if requested. This option allows to narrow the answers down to either \fIaddresses\fP or \fIprefixes\fP\&.
\fIDefault: addresses\fP
.TP
.B \fBcall_up = <executable> [$prefix$] [$length$] [$router$]\fP
When a route is requested and accepted the custom \fIexecutable\fP will called and the optional but senseful variables will be filled with their appropriate values.
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B \fB$prefix$\fP
Contains the prefix advertised to the client.
.TP
.B \fB$length$\fP
The prefix length.
.TP
.B \fB$router$\fP

.UNINDENT
.TP
.B \fBbootfiles = <bootfile> [<bootfile> ...]\fP
List of PXE bootfiles to evaluate for clients in this client. Each value must refer a bootfile section (see below). Each bootfile is evaluated by the filter defined in the bootfile section, the first machting bootfile is chosen.
.sp
Example:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
\fIbootfiles = eth1_ipxe eth1_efi64 eth1_efi32 eth1_efibc\fP
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS Default Class
.sp
At the moment every client which does not match any other class by client configuration or filter automatically matches the class "default".
This class could get an address scheme too. It should be enough if \(aqaddress_default\(aq is defined, only if unknown clients should get extra nameservers etc. a \(aqclass_default\(aq has to be set.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fB[class_default]\fP
Default class for all clients that do not match any other class. Like any other class it might contain all options that appyl to a class.
.TP
.B \fB[class_default_<interface>]\fP
If dhcpy6d listens at multiple interfaces, one can define a default class for every \(aqinterface\(aq.
.UNINDENT
.SH BOOTFILE DEFINITIONS IN MULTIPLE [BOOTFILE_<BOOTFILE_NAME>] SECTIONS
.sp
The \fI<bootfile_name>\fP part of an \fB[bootfile_<bootfile_name>]\fP section is an arbitrarily chosen identifier like \fIefi32\fP, \fIbios\fP or \fIefi64\fP\&.
Each bootfile can be restricted to an architecture and/or an user class which is sent by the PXE client.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBbootfile_url = <url>\fP
The bootfile URL in a format like \fItftp://[2001:db8:85a3::8a2e:370:7334]/pxe.efi\fP\&. The possible protocols are dependent on the PXE client, TFTP should be supported by almost every client.
.TP
.B \fBclient_architecture = <architecture>\fP
Optionally restrict the bootfile to a specific CPU architecture. If the client doesn\(aqt match the requirement, the next bootfile assigned to the class definition is chosen or no bootfile is provided, if there are no
further alternatives.
.sp
Either the integer identifier for an architecture is possible (e.g. 0009 for EFI x86\-64). The integer must consists of four numeric digits, empty digits must be written as zero (e.g. 9 => 0009). For a full list of
possible integer identifier see \fI\%https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4578#section\-2.1\fP\&. Alternatively the well\-known names of registered CPU architectures defined in RF4578 can be used:

.SS Minimal configuration

.INDENT 3.5
Here in this minimalistic example the server daemon listens on interface eth0. It does not use any client configuration source but answers requests with default addresses.
These are made of the pattern fd01:db8:dead:bad:beef:$mac$ and result in addresses like fd01:db8:deaf:bad:beef:1020:3040:5060 if the MAC address of the requesting client was 10:20:30:40:50:60.
