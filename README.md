dhcpy6d
=======

Dhcpy6d delivers IPv6 addresses and prefixes for DHCPv6 clients, which can be identified by DUID, hostname or MAC address as in the good old IPv4 days.
Addresses may be generated randomly, by range, by arbitrary ID or MAC address.
Clients can get more than one address, leases and client configuration can be stored in databases and DNS can be updated dynamically
Range-based prefixes be delegated as well as fixed prefixes per client.
Changing prefixes from ISP can be applied dynamically.

Supported platforms include Linux, OpenBSD, FreeBSD, NetBSD and macOS. At any other POSIX OS it might work too.
